            During my first year of teaching French in Saint Louis, I decided that I was going to apply for the <a href="https://frenchhighereducation.org/teaching-assistant-program">Teaching Assistant Program in France (TAPIF)</a>. It is an opportunity to work as an English language assistant (<i>une assistante de langue anglaise</i>) in metropolitan France and some of its territories (e.g. French Polynesia, island of <i>Saint-Martin</i>, Caribbean island of <i><a href="https://us.martinique.org/">Martinique</a></i>, etc.).
         </p>
        
        <p>
            At this point, I had already been to France twice, once as a tourist in <a href="https://en.parisinfo.com/">Paris</a> and once for study abroad in the <a href="https://www.visit.alsace/en/">Alsace region</a>. I knew that I wanted to explore another region so when I indicated my preferences during the application process, I marked the southern city of Montpellier as my number 1 choice. In April, I received my official acceptance letter stating that I would be placed in the <i><a href="https://www.ac-montpellier.fr/">Académie de Montpellier</a></i>, and in July, I learned that I would be traveling between a high school (<i>un lycée</i>) in Clermont-l'Hérault and a middle school (<i>un collège</i>) in Saint-André-de-Sangonis.

            <p>The majority of my time was spent in Clermont l'Hérault, as my schedule was made up of classes at the local high school. With this in mind, I decided to find lodging in town, and I became aquainted with a French woman named Marianne, who opened her home to renters. Marianne had played the part of host to other language assistants like me for over 10 years, and during my time there, I met a Spanish language assistant, Raquel, who also rented a room there.</p>

            <p>On Mondays, I spent my time at the <i>Collège Max Rouquette</i> (middle school) in Saint-André-de-Sangonis, and since I did not have a car, I had to find figure out public transportation. As an American, the situation interested me simply because in the U.S., I have my own vehicle and very rarely take public transportion. In France, it is the norm to take public transit, including trains, for daily travel.

            <h2><i>Bon voyage!</i></h2>
            <h4>have a nice trip</h4>
            <p>Living in France for 3.5 months afforded me the opportunity to travel to other European countries. Right before our teaching contracts began, my friend and I went to Munich for Oktoberfest, which I now consider one of the best times I have ever had in my life. We stayed 2 nights at a camping site and somehow figured out our way around town without anyone communicating with us in English. (Neither of us speak German.) It was a short an sweet trip!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The French are known for their <i>les vacances</i> (vacation/time off), and we had two weeks off around Halloween. With this time off, we took a train to Zurich then the <a href="https://www.seat61.com/trains-and-routes/bernina-express.htm">Bernina Express</a>, a slow moving train that starts in Chur, Switzerland and ends in Tirano, Italy, traversing the Alps. Because of the time of year, we started our journey in the lush, green countryside of Switzerland, made a pitstop at snowy Alp Grüm, and ended up in beautiful Italy. From there, we took yet another train (albeit a less dreamy, regional one) to Milan where we stayed a night before moving on to our destination, Florence. WHile I feel like our experience there was a very touristy one, it was a cool city, and having breakfast on top of the <a href = "https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi">Uffizi Gallery</a> was one of the highlights of this particular sojourn. <b>(BONUS: Ask about the return trip to France and having to stop at the Swiss border control.)</b></p>

            <p>Lastly, and one of my most memorable parts of the entire experience of living in France, was the <a href="https://noel-colmar.com/en/"></a><i>marchés de Noêl</i> (Christmas markets) in Colmar, France</a>. This event is several weeks long and includes special shows and quaint booths where one can buy festive knick-knacks. Attending the <i>marchés</i> was particularly specialto me because even though they are found all over the country, Alsace is the most prominant (and often considered the origin of the European Christmas markets), and as I previously mentioned, my favorite region in the entire country... and Colmar is my favorite city in the entire world.</p>
