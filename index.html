            During my first year of teaching French in Saint Louis, I decided that I was going to apply for the <a href="https://frenchhighereducation.org/teaching-assistant-program">Teaching Assistant Program in France (TAPIF)</a>. It is an opportunity to work as an English language assistant (<i>une assistante de langue anglaise</i>) in metropolitan France and some of its territories (e.g. French Polynesia, island of <i>Saint-Martin</i>, Caribbean island of <i><a href="https://us.martinique.org/">Martinique</a></i>, etc.).
         </p>
        
        <p>
            At this point, I had already been to France twice, once as a tourist in <a href="https://en.parisinfo.com/">Paris</a> and once for study abroad in the <a href="https://www.visit.alsace/en/">Alsace region</a>. I knew that I wanted to explore another region so when I indicated my preferences during the application process, I marked the southern city of Montpellier as my number 1 choice. In April, I received my official acceptance letter stating that I would be placed in the <i><a href="https://www.ac-montpellier.fr/">Académie de Montpellier</a></i>, and in July, I learned that I would be traveling between a high school (<i>un lycée</i>) in Clermont-l'Hérault and a middle school (<i>un collège</i>) in Saint-André-de-Sangonis.

            <h4>a typical day</h3>
            <p>The majority of my time was spent in Clermont l'Hérault, as my schedule was made up of classes at the local high school. With this in mind, I decided to find lodging in town, and I became aquainted with a French woman named Marianne, who opened her home to renters. Marianne had played the part of host to other language assistants like me for over 10 years, and during my time there, I met a Spanish language assistant, Raquel, who also rented a room there.</p>
            <p>On Mondays, I spent my time at the <i>Collège Max Rouquette</i> (middle school) in Saint-André-de-Sangonis, and since I did not have a car, I had to find figure out public transportation. As an American, the situation interested me simply because in the U.S., I have my own vehicle and very rarely take public transportion. In France, it is the norm to take public transit, including trains, for daily travel.</p>
